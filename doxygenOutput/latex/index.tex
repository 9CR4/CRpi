C\+Rpi is a C library dedicated to the Raspberry Pi providing utilities and direct access to some hardware peripherals. It includes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item P\+WM signal generation using the D\+MA (see \hyperlink{pwmByDma_8h}{pwm\+By\+Dma.\+h})
\item Interface to the G\+P\+IO peripheral (see \hyperlink{gpio_8h}{gpio.\+h})
\item Interface to the P\+WM peripheral (see \hyperlink{pwm_8h}{pwm.\+h})
\item Interface to the D\+MA peripheral (see \hyperlink{dma_8h}{dma.\+h})
\item Interface to the Clock Manager peripheral (see \hyperlink{clockManager_8h}{clock\+Manager.\+h})
\end{DoxyItemize}

It also includes some utilies, most notably \hyperlink{cacheCoherentMemoryProvider_8h}{cache\+Coherent\+Memory\+Provider.\+h}

It currently supports Raspberry Pi 2 and 3 model B, it\textquotesingle{}s tested only on the R\+PI 3 but should work also on the 2.
